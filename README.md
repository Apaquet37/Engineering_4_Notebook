## Hello Raspberry Pi
This was my first time ever using a raspberry pi, but this was really just a simple intro assignment. The raspberry pi is a computer, and all it needs is a keyboard, mouse, and monitor to be usable. The biggest hurdle was getting the raspberry pi connected to my computer, but I found that oftentimes a little patience goes a long way and if you wait for the light on the raspberry pi to be completely stable, it will usually work well. Once connected to the computer, I just talked to the pi over serial in a terminal like setting. Then, I ran code that printed hello world 10 times.

## Get Your Pi Online
The goal of this assignment was fairly simple, to get my pi connected to the internet. Aside from making sure all the syntax was correct in the configuration page, the only part I found tricky was pushing changes I had made to github. I didn't have trouble cloning my repository to the raspberry pi, adding or committing changes, but when I went to push those changes (after I had typed in my email and username) I got a message saying that my repository had been corrupted, and I was no longer able to do any git commands. The way I fixed this was by deleting my repo and then re-cloning it back onto the pi from github.
